                            <p>Are your students planning to study abroad in a postgraduate program? While applying, they
                                may be asked to submit standardized test scores. Two of the most widely accepted
                                standardized tests by postgraduate programs are the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and
                                the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT), especially for business and management, as
                                well as many other programs.</p>
                            <h3>Test Overview</h3>
                            <p>The GRE and the GMAT are standardized entrance tests that measures a student’s readiness for
                                graduate-level programs. Although some business schools also accept GRE scores, if your
                                students are considering a future in consulting, management, or logistics, the GMAT is
                                likely a better match. Both tests are accepted in many countries around the world such as
                                the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and many more. </p>

                                <li><strong>GRE:</strong> The GRE is one of the most widely accepted standardized test for
                                    graduate school or business school in English-speaking countries, and is accepted in
                                    over 90 countries. Applicants taking the GRE can choose between the GRE General Test or
                                    the GRE Subject Test. The GRE general test measures an applicant’s general academic
                                    ability to think and communicate, while the GRE subject test looks at an applicant’s
                                    knowledge in a specific domain and is meant for applicants with a strong background or
                                    undergraduate major in a specific STEM discipline.</li>
                                <li><strong>GMAT:</strong> The GMAT is a standardized test for Master’s of Business
                                    Administration (MBA) applicants. According to the Graduate Management Admissions
                                    Council, more than 2,400 schools in 110 countries use the GMAT exam as part of the
                                    selection criteria for their programs.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>GRE & GMAT Benefits</h3>
                            <p>In addition to providing schools with standardized test scores, taking the GRE or GMAT can
                                have added academic, professional, and financial benefits for students who are planning to
                                study at the graduate level.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>GRE:</strong> Admissions and fellowship committees use GRE results to complement
                                    undergraduate records, recommendation letters, and other applicant qualifications.
                                    Taking a GRE Subject Test can help your students stand out from other postgraduate
                                    candidates when applying to a competitive program. In addition, getting a good score on
                                    the GRE can bring further benefits, such as helping students receive scholarships or
                                    teaching assistant positions.</li>
                                <li><strong>GMAT:</strong> Business schools see GMAT scores as a measure of future MBA
                                    student success because the GMAT looks at how students can apply their knowledge in
                                    real-world business situations. The GMAT evaluates problem-solving, logic, critical
                                    reasoning, and writing skills which contribute to an applicant’s success in business
                                    programs.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Test Score System</h3>
                            <p>There are two parts to the GRE and GMAT results. The first part is the score, which varies by
                                test type, and the second part is a percentile ranking for each of the scores.</p>
                            <p>The percentile ranking tells applicants and their prospective schools how well they scored
                                compared to other test takers. So a score with a percentile ranking of 80, means the
                                applicant scored higher than 80% of applicants and equally or lower than 20% of applicants.
                                Note, that because rankings are recalculated every year and GRE/GMAT test scores are valid
                                for multiple years, your student’s percentile may change over time.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>GRE:</strong> The raw GRE test score (number of questions answered correctly) is
                                    converted to a scaled score. Scaled scores are generally between 130 and 170 for the GRE
                                    General. For GRE Subject tests, the usual score range is between 320 and 990.</li>
                                <li><strong>GMAT:</strong> Applicants that have taken the GMAT test will receive scores for
                                    each of the four test sections, plus a total score. The total score is based on
                                    performance on the verbal and quantitative sections. Total scores for GMAT are reported
                                    in 10-point intervals from 200–800 (e.g. 500, 510, 520). According to the Graduate
                                    Management Admission Council (GMAC), two thirds of GMAT test-takers score between 400
                                    and 800.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Test Content</h3>
                            <p>The GRE General and the GMAT are both adaptive, which means that the difficulty of future
                                questions depends on how applicants do early in the test. </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>GRE:</strong> The contents of GRE Subject tests vary by area of study
                                    (Chemistry, Physics, Math, or Psychology). The GRE General test contains three sections,
                                    including verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and analytical writing.</li>
                                <li><strong>GMAT:</strong> The GMAT contains four sections including analytical writing,
                                    integrated reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and verbal reasoning. These sections
                                    evaluate the applicant’s skills in critical thinking and communication, data analysis
                                    and information interpretation, numerical literacy and math as well as editing and
                                    reading comprehension.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Length & Format of Test</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>GRE:</strong> Applicants can complete the GRE General Test at a testing center
                                    as a paper-based test or as an at-home, computer-based test. The GRE takes about 3 hours
                                    and 45 minutes to complete. The GRE subject test is a paper based and is offered up to
                                    three times every year in September, October, and/or April. Testing times vary, so it is
                                    important to check with nearby test centers early to reserve spots.</li>
                                <li><strong>GMAT:</strong> Applicants can complete the GMAT online or on computers at GMAT
                                    test centers. Students have up to 3 hours and 7 minutes to complete the test.</li>

                            <h3>Additional tips</h3>
                            <p>Whether your students are choosing the GRE general test, GRE subject test or GMAT, advise
                                them to take the admissions test a few months before the intake date of their chosen
                                program.</p>
                            <p>This will allow time to prepare and retake the test if needed, especially if it’s a GRE
                                Subject exam, so that your students can present their best score to prospective schools.
                                Both the GRE and GMAT may be re-taken, but each attempt costs an exam fee, so be sure to use
                                free online GMAT practice tests and resources to help your students prepare.</p>
                            <p>In addition to standardized test scores, colleges and universities will also consider an
                                applicant’s previous academic performance and work experience as part of the student’s
                                application. To give your students the best chance of success, it’s important to research
                                each program your students are applying to so you can understand the main program
                                priorities.</p>
                            <p>Some programs may care more about specific scores within the overall result, while more
                                competitive programs may weigh all scores equally, and this will help you determine where to
                                focus extra attention when training your students to maximize their chances of success.</p>
