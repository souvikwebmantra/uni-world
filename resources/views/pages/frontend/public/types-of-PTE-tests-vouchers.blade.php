              <h3>PTE A1, A2 & B2</h3>
              <p>PTE A1, PTE A2, and PTE B2 exams should be taken by people who are hoping to live and work in the UK.</p>
              <p>These tests are less academically focused. They are also generally less difficult than the PTE Academic & PTE UKVI exams.</p>
              <p>Here is a summary of each of these tests and their use cases:</p>

              <h3>PTE Academic & PTE UKVI</h3>
              <p><strong>Similarities</strong></p>
              <p>The PTE Academic and the PTE UKVI are actually the same test.</p>
              <p>Both tests are an integrated test meant to test your student’s speaking, writing, reading, and listening skills. They use the same questions and the tests are scored the same.</p>
              <p>The PTE Academic & PTE UKVI were updated on November 16th, 2021. Changes to the tests included:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Shorter Length: Changed from 3 hours to 2 hours</li>
                <li>Improved Feedback: Now provides personalized feedback on your student’s test performance as well as advice on how to improve</li>
                <li>Online Availability: The PTE Academic can now be taken online (depending on your institution and country)</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Differences</h3>
              <p>The only functional difference between the PTE Academic and the PTE UKVI is the registration process. The PTE UKVI is only relevant for study abroad applications to the UK. The UKVI should be used when your student requires a SELT Unique Reference Number (URN) for their visa application.</p>
