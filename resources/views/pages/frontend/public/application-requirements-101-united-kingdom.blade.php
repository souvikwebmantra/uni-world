                                                        education courses, and these vary widely depending on the subject,

                                                    <p>Education providers require students to have successfully attained
                                                        prior levels of qualifications to ensure they will have the right

                                                        course. Students need to provide transcripts to show they meet the

                                                    <p>Higher marks are usually needed to gain admission into more
                                                        competitive or in-demand courses. Most courses will also expect

                                                        part of the admission process. Standardized English language tests
                                                        evaluate students on their reading, listening, speaking and writing
