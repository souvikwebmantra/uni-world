                            <p>If you’re working with a student looking to study overseas, it’s very likely they will need
                                to complete an English proficiency test. Most English-language schools need students to
                                complete this type of test before applying to study. Test results show how well the student
                                can communicate in English and ensure they won’t have too many challenges during their
                                studies.</p>
                            <p>There are several different English proficiency tests including IELTS, TOEFL, and PTE.
                                Different schools accept different tests and each test has different key features. That’s
                                why it’s important to know where the student wants to study before helping them choose which
                                test to take. Let’s take a closer look at each test type.</p>
                            <h3>Where Each Test is Accepted</h3>
                            <p>All three major tests are accepted at many English colleges and universities. Over the past
                                few years, many schools have started accepting more test types. However, some schools may
                                not accept online or “at-home” test results. Be sure to check exactly which tests are needed
                                for each school your student wants to apply to.</p>
