                        <p>With two official languages, Canada is an especially inviting destination for Francophone
                            students looking to study either in English or French. Institutions across Canada offer a
                            variety of programs in French-language instruction, attracting students from all over the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>In Canada, Francophone students can access a world-class education and job opportunities. The
                            ability to speak French also serves as a highly sought employment skill for students hoping to
                            work in Canada post-graduation. This makes Canada a popular destination country for Francophone
                            international students looking to study abroad.</p>
                        <p>So, how is this student population growing, and what countries are they coming from? What are
                            Francophone students studying? Today, we’ll be answering these questions and more.</p>
                        <h3>Key Insights at a Glance</h3>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>Francophone International Students in Canada Growing Steadily</h3>
                        <p>The chart below shows the number of new study permits approved for Francophone students in Canada
                            from 2016 to 2022:</p>
                        <div class="sub-our-story-img-blog">
                            <img src="{{ asset('assets/frontend/assets/images/blogs/01-canada-growing-steadily.png') }}"
                                alt="" />
                        </div>
                        <p>The number of Francophone international students approved to study in Canada has increased
                            year-over-year since 2016 with the exception of 2020. From 2016 to 2021, the number of
                            Francophone international students approved to study in Canada increased by 15,000. This
                            represented a growth of 117% in five years.</p>
                        <p>Following the pandemic, over 21,000 Francophone international students were approved to study in
                            Canada in the first eight months of 2022. This puts Canada back on track to keep growing
                            year-over-year from last year’s high.</p>
                        <h3>Where Are Francophone International Students Travelling From?</h3>
                        <p>Francophone international students are coming to Canada from France, Belgium and French Africa.
                            The chart below breaks down the top 10 countries that Francophone international students are
                            traveling from:</p>
                        <div class="sub-our-story-img-blog">
                            <img src="{{ asset('assets/frontend/assets/images/blogs/02-canada-growing-steadily.png') }}"
                                alt="" />
                        </div>
                        <p>France, Morocco, and Algeria have consistently been the top three source markets for Francophone
                            students in Canada. Since 2016, France has held the number one spot as the top country that
                            Francophone students are coming from.</p>
                        <p>Despite an average drop of one percentage point in approval rates across the top 10 countries of
                            origin, some countries of origin saw an increase in approval rates from 2019. Showing strong
                            growth, Belgium more than doubled in new study permit approvals from 2019 to 2021. Senegal,
                            Haiti, and Lebanon also saw an increase in approval rates from 2021 into early 2022.</p>
                        <p>Since August 2022, Francophone students from Congo, Cameroon, Haiti, Guinea, and Mali have
                            surpassed full year study permit approvals from 2021.</p>
                        <h3>What Do Francophone Students Study in Canada?</h3>
                        <p>Some schools in Canada offer programs that combine classroom studies with sightseeing and
                            cultural activities to broaden the student experience and build connections. Schools may also
                            offer work-study programs for students to practice their skills in the workplace. This allows
                            students to explore their school environments and build industry connections to launch into the
                            workforce.</p>
                        <p>The chart below breaks down the percentage of Francophone international students by study level.
                        </p>
                        <div class="sub-our-story-img-blog">
                            <img src="{{ asset('assets/frontend/assets/images/blogs/03-canada-growing-steadily.png') }}"
                                alt="" />
                        </div>
                        <p>The majority of Francophone students coming to Canada end up studying in Quebec, Ontario and New
                            Brunswick. With two publicly funded French-language colleges, Ontario offers Francophone
                            students the opportunity to choose from these or 10 French-language and bilingual institutions
                            with university programs. It’s also worth noting that New Brunswick is the only official
                            bilingual province in Canada.</p>
                        <p>Quebec hosted nearly four in five Francophone students in 2021. In comparison, 13% of Francophone
                            students studied in Ontario.</p>
                        <p>Nearly 19 out of 20 of Francophone students approved to study in Canada were enrolled in
                            post-secondary studies in 2021. In comparison, less than 1% of Francophone international
                            students were enrolled in K-12 programs, and under 1% pursued ESL/FSL programs in 2021.</p>
                        <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
                        <p>2021 was a strong year for international education in Canada. The success of Canada’s generous
                            Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) has played a key role in Canada’s growth, with over
                            97% of eligible PGWP applicants approved between January of 2016 and July of 2022.</p>
                        <p>With strong Francophone communities outside of Quebec, Canada is a popular destination country
                            for Francophone students to start their study abroad journey. Increased efforts from the
                            Canadian government to attract more students shows a strong government commitment to support
                            Francophone students in Canada.</p>
                        <p>We expect to see more Francophone students headed to Canada, as a part of the continued growth we
                            are seeing across the country. Schools looking to attract more Francophone students to study in
                            Canada can:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Highlight existing Francophone communities in Canada, within and outside of Quebec.</li>
                            <li>Promote the broad variety of French-language education programs offered in Canada.</li>
                            <li>Encourage students to work with informed representatives to support their recruitment goals.
                            </li>
                            <li>Ensure that students are up to date about Canada’s successful programs to support
                                international students, including the PGWP.</li>
                        </ul>
